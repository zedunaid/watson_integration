# Introduction

The `web` microservice acts as the frontend of the watson-integration. It is a React JS application.


# Getting Started

In order to get started with this application. First clone the project using 

```bash
git clone https://github.com/AkshayRaman97/watson_integration.git
```

To run the project locally use these commands

```bash
# Go into the web microservice
$ cd microservices/web/app

# Install node packages
$ npm install

# Run the app
$ npm start
```

Your microservice would be running at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

Edit your `App.js` file to get started with your own app.
